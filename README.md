## Salary Predctor: Univariate Linear Regression Project

This dataset is derived from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishek14398/salary-dataset-simple-linear-regression)

The dataset is synthetic and was created by the author for teaching and learning purposes. It includes three columns: the row numbers, employees' years of experience, and employees' salaries.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in univariate linear regression. Through my comments, codes, and notes, I aim to highlight my critical and analytical thinking skills, as well as my expertise in exploratory data analysis, building machine learning models, interpreting results, evaluating performance, and deriving actionable insights and recommendations.
